This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project shows how to authenticate react app with WebApi using latest React Hooks and Redux.

In order to run this project, you need create a webapi project using Visual Studio 2017 with Authentication type "Individual".

The following packages are used: Redux, React-Redux, Redux-Logger, Redux-Thunk, Redux-Persist, React-router-dom, Axios and Bootstrap. The project uses only functional components with React 16.8 Hooks which makes the application very easy to write and use. This project will be useful for somebody trying to persist the authentication in Redux, In this project you will see Register, Login and Logout functionality using WebApi token based authentication and all API calls are done using Axios Post/Get methods.

You have to change the webapi address in react, i am using http://localhost:64414/...., you change according to your port and address.
